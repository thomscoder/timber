Timber is a word finding game.

Find the game at: https://timber-game.vercel.app

## How does it work?
Timber implements some algorithms and data structures under the hood:

- Trie: when launched, with the help of Faker, it generates <strong>2 millions</strong> of random words and store them into a trie.
- A*: to calculate the shortest path between two clicked letters.
- DFS: to identify islands and auto removing one-cell islands..

## Roadmap

- [ ] Multiplayer
- [ ] Boggle
