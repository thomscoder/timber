Timber is a word finding game.

## How does it work?
Timber implements some algorithms and data structures under the hood:

- Trie: with the help of Faker, Timber generates <strong>1 million</strong> of random words and store them into a trie.
- A*: to calculate the shortest path between two clicked letters.
- DFS: to identify islands and auto removing one-cell islands..
